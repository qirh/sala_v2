![Build](https://github.com/qirh/sala_v2/workflows/Build/badge.svg)  [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/29595778-1307-4507-8c47-2d05b733ee43/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/musing-rosalind-eedabd/deploys)

Vue webstie. Hosted on Netlify.

don't forget to update the version in `store.js` if there are breaking changes to invalidate cache

note:
* This is a deprecated website built with Vue 2.0. I'll replace it with a new one hopefully soon.
* `node-sass` is broken with node >= 16. so you have to use node <= 14. latest npm version that works in `14.9.3`. Netlify still supports node 14, but Vercel does not.

to run:
* `nvm use 14.19.3`
* `npm run serve`
