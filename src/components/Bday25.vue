        Friends, familiares, familia, welcome to another one of my (some would say stupid, i would say creative) ideas
        <br />
        <br />
        As you might know, I was born around this general time of year many years ago. And I want to participate in the festivities that people usually partake in when this time of year comes
        <br />
        <br />
        So, I thought why not celebrate like them. And so ... I'm gonna celebrate by running from NJ to CT. A tri-state run
        <br />
        <br />
        
        <img
            width="800px"
            height="auto"
            rel="preload"
            src="/assets/bday25_route.jpeg"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm not sure what the total mileage will be, but I think it should be close to ~24-28 miles üò®
        <br />
        <br />
        The general route is Fort Lee, NJ -> (thru GWB) Manhattan -> Then roughly follow the East Coast Greenway from The Bronx -> Westchester -> Greenwich, CT
        Then come back home on the Metro North
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm gonna do it this Sunday, July 13th. And start at 7am from Fort Lee, NJ
        <br />
        <br />
        Now you might be wondering, how can I help you celebrate?
        <br />
        <br />
        Well ... I think this will be a very miserable experience. But if you want to join me (in spirit), you can add songs to this <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2WFFJGE3XG2rp29MqHM9wr?si=ee8573c051864aec&pt=5a1b2e5e37a94e77b1b3eb0885052cca"
            >Spotify playlist.</a
        > but please keep it to 5 songs or less, I'll be running for a day not a week haha
        <br />
        <br />
        And if you want to follow me I will post a link here on Saturday night for my live Google Maps location (since I am on Android now, find my friends doesn't work)
        <br />
        <br />
        Ultimately, you are seeing this page because you are very (very) near and dear to my heart and I want to thank you for your beautiful presence in my life ‚ù§Ô∏è
        <br />
        And in case I haven't told you lately, I love you and I honestly don't know where I would be without you in my life.
