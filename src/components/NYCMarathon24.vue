        Hello dear friends :) Welcome to my 2024 NYC Marathon cheerleading squad invitation page.
        <br />
        <br />
        As you might know,  I made a decision 2 years ago to work on getting a bib for the NYC Marathon. It was a lot of work to get a guaranteed entry, but I did it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Back then I categorized this decision as a "later" problem, the marathon was so far in the future. And that I would either train for it, or I would cancel my participation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Well, that time is now, and I have neither trained for it nor cancelled. Which is the one thing I told myself I would not do.
        <br />
        <br />
        It will be a day (hopefully I finish within 24 hours) of pure pain and misery, and I will probably take a very long time to finish, but inshallah.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Logistics (in case you want to come support me, and you should)</h3>
        Figuring out logistics of where to meet someone during NYC marathon is tough work. I assume that I will not have access to my phone most of the race (it will be in my fanny pack).
        <br />
        <br />
        The marathon is on Nov 3, 2024. My wave start is at 10:30am. My bib number is <b>35052</b>. You can track me (and other runners) on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/6680190121">Ios</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tcs.mobility.nyrr">Android</a> apps.
