        <br />
        Hello and welcome to my NYC marathon 2025 edition fan page.
        
        As you (should) know, 2025 was the hardest year of my life in a while. And instead of sitting down actually solving my problems, I decided to run run run away from them.

        Thankfully I ran so much that I outran them and now their in the backmirror so far away and this year has turned around and is much much better (alhamdulilah).
        
        Anyways I'm running the marathon on Nov 2, 2025.

        I know it may be hard to believe for some of you, but I did put effort and trained extensively for this one. I follow a 12 week training plan:
