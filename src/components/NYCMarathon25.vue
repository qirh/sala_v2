        <h1>Letter to Shareholders re: 2nd annual Invitation to see me run the NYC marathon</h1>

        <h3>To our dear shareowners:</h3>
        <br />
        Thanks for being part of the Saleh Inc. journey. It's been exciting so far.
        <br />
        <br />
        In last years letter to shareholders (that I forgot to send). I talked about my hope to reinvent what it means to run a <i>fast</i> Marathon. I noted that I have grown from not being able to walk 33 years ago to hoping to finish my first marathon. I wrote that this was just the beginning for Saleh Inc.
        <br />
        <br />
        We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight CUSTOMERS. Last year, we ran a <b>VERY</b> <i>slow</i> marathon due to lack of training and preparedness.
        <br />
        <br />
        HOWEVER! Past marathon performance is not indicative of future results. This year, we will run a <b>VERY</b> <i>fast</i> marathon, because we have followed a <b>VERY</b> intense (HIIT) 12 week training plan:  
        <br />
        <h3>Week 1 -- personal record for that session</h3>

        <h3>Week 10 -- despite challenging market conditions, we made it out of bed that day</h3>

        />
        <h3>Week 11 -- corportate retreat -- no time for training</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>Week 12 -- strategic partnership with emotional support personnel ❤️❤️❤️❤️</h3>

        <h1>Logistics: how to track me</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>For maximum stakeholder visibility and transparency, I encourage all our shareholders to come out and see me in person actually running the marathon.</li>
            <li>The marathon is this Sunday. <b>Nov 2, 2025</b>.</li>
            <li>Here is the <a href="https://webassets.nyrr.org/nyrrwebsiteassets/TCSNYCM25_Map_Course_080625_M_OL.pdf" target="_blank">course map</a></li>
            <li>My bib number is <b>27769</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>You can track me using <b>find my friends</b> if you have an iphone, just lmk if you don't have me and I'll add you.</li>
                    <li>Or through the tracking app from the race organizers <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/race-day/mobile-app" target="_blank">link</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I am part of wave 3, which starts at 10:20am. My goal is an 8 min/mile pace, but realisticly, it will be closer to 8:30 min/mile with me getting slower the further I am in the race, you know what they say, no company is perfect.</li>
            <li>For your convenience, see Q4 Performance Metrics. i.e. a best-effort estimate of expected marathon performance</li>
