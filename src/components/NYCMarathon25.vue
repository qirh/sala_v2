        <h2>2nd annual Invitation to see me suffer the NYC marathon</h2>

        <br />
        <br />
        Hello and welcome to my NYC marathon 2025 edition fan page.
        <br />
        <br />
        2025 <i>was</i> a very tough year for many people, me included.
        I had planned to be intentional and thoughtful about solving these problems, but instead I decided to run away from them and now all these problems are in the backmirror so far away but they can always catch up and so I gotta keeep running running and so I am doing the NYC marathon on Nov 2, 2025.
        <br />
        <br />

        I know it may be hard to believe for some of you, but I did put effort and trained extensively for this one. I followed a very intense and rigrous 12 week training plan:
        <br />

        <h1>Logistics: how to track me</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Here is the <a href="https://webassets.nyrr.org/nyrrwebsiteassets/TCSNYCM25_Map_Course_080625_M_OL.pdf" target="_blank">course map</a></li>
            <li>My bib number is <b>27769</b>.

            </li>
            <li>I am part of wave 3, which starts at 10:20am. My goal is an 8 min/mile pace, but realisticly, it will be closer to 8:30 min/mile with me getting slower the further I am in the race, you know nobody is perfect.</li>
