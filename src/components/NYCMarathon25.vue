        <h3>To our dear shareowners:</h3>
        <br />
        Thanks for buying Saleh inc shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        In last years letter to shareholders (that I forgot to send), my first, I talked about my hope to reinvent what it means to run a <i>fast</i> Marathon. I noted that I have grown from not being able to walk 33 years ago to hoping to finish my first marathon. I wrote that this was just the beginning for Saleh inc.
        <br />

        We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we ran a very slow marathon due to lack of training and preparedness.
        <br />
        <br />
        HOWEVER! This year, we will run a VERY fast marathon, because we have followed a very rigorous 12 week training plan:  
        <br />
        <h3>Week 1 -- personal record for that session</h3>

            src="/assets/training_2.jpg"
        />

        <h3>Week 10 -- it was hard to get out of bed and train that day, but with persistence and strength, i made it</h3>
        <img
            width="300px"
            height="auto"
            rel="preload"

        <h3>Week 12 -- ❤️❤️❤️ absolutely the best ❤️❤️❤️❤️</h3>

        <h1>Logistics: how to track me</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Here is the <a href="https://webassets.nyrr.org/nyrrwebsiteassets/TCSNYCM25_Map_Course_080625_M_OL.pdf" target="_blank">course map</a></li>
            <li>My bib number is <b>27769</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>You can track me using <b>find my friends</b> if you have an iphone, just lmk if you don't have me and I'll add you.</li>
                    <li>Or through the tracking app from the race organizers <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/race-day/mobile-app" target="_blank">link</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I am part of wave 3, which starts at 10:20am. My goal is an 8 min/mile pace, but realisticly, it will be closer to 8:30 min/mile with me getting slower the further I am in the race, you know nobody is perfect.</li>
            <li>For your convenience, see attached a best-effort estimate of my expected marathon performance</li>
